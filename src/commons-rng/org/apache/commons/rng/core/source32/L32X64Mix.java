/**
 * A 32-bit all purpose generator.
 *
 * <p>This is a member of the LXM family of generators: L=Linear congruential generator;
 * X=Xor based generator; and M=Mix. This member uses a 32-bit LCG and 64-bit Xor-based
 * generator. It is named as {@code "L32X64MixRandom"} in the {@code java.util.random}
 * package introduced in JDK 17; the LXM family is described in further detail in:
 *
 * <blockquote>Steele and Vigna (2021) LXM: better splittable pseudorandom number generators
 * (and almost as fast). Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages, Volume 5,
 * Article 148, pp 1â€“31.</blockquote>
 *
 * <p>Memory footprint is 128 bits and the period is 2<sup>32</sup> (2<sup>64</sup> - 1).
 *
 * <p>This generator implements {@link LongJumpableUniformRandomProvider}.
 * In addition instances created with a different additive parameter for the LCG are robust
 * against accidental correlation in a multi-threaded setting. The additive parameters must be
 * different in the most significant 31-bits.
 *
 * <p>This generator implements
 * {@link org.apache.commons.rng.SplittableUniformRandomProvider SplittableUniformRandomProvider}.
 * The stream of generators created using the {@code splits} methods support parallelisation
 * and are robust against accidental correlation by using unique values for the additive parameter
 * for each instance in the same stream. The primitive streaming methods support parallelisation
 * but with no assurances of accidental correlation; each thread uses a new instance with a
 * randomly initialised state.
